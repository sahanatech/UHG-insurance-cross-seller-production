# UHG Insurance Cross-Seller Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict cross-selling opportunities for UHG (UnitedHealth Group) insurance products using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify potential customers who are likely to purchase additional insurance products based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uhg-insurance-cross-seller.git
   
   
2. Install Python dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage

1. Ensure your dataset (`insurance_data.csv`) is in the project directory.

2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data:
   
   python preprocess.py
   

3. Train the machine learning model:
   
   python train_model.py
   

4. Make predictions using the trained model:
   
   python predict.py
   

## File Descriptions

- `preprocess.py`: Python script for data preprocessing.
- `train_model.py`: Python script to train the machine learning model.
- `predict.py`: Python script to make predictions using the trained model.
- `insurance_data.csv`: Example dataset used for training and testing.
